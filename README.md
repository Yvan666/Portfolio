Just some amateur web pages that I made. I wanted to see what can I learn and do with HTML, CSS and little JS. Some templates are from google, I just remade it and put my stuff in it.
Unfortunately I don't have source codes of web pages on this template, only this one, but there are images of those pages at least.
